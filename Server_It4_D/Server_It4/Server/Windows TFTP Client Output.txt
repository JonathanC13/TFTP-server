Tftp
Transfers files to and from a remote computer, typically a computer running UNIX, that is
running the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) service or daemon. Used without
parameters, tftp displays help.

Syntax
tftp [-i] [Host] [{get | put}] [Source] [Destination]

Parameters
-i : Specifies binary image transfer mode (also called octet mode). In binary image mode, the file is transferred in onebyte units. Use this mode when transferring binary files. If it is omitted, the file is transferred in ASCII mode. This is the default transfer mode. This mode converts the endofline (EOL) characters to an appropriate format for the specified
computer. Use this mode when transferring text files. If a file transfer is successful, the data transfer rate is displayed.

Host : Specifies the local or remote computer.

put : Transfers the file Destination on the local computer to the file Source on the remote computer. Because the TFTP protocol does not support user authentication, the user must be logged onto the remote computer, and the files must be writable on the remote computer.

get : Transfers the file Destination on the remote computer to the file Source on the local computer.

Source : Specifies the file to transfer.

Destination : Specifies where to transfer the file. If Destination is omitted, it is assumed to have the same name as Source.

/? : Displays help at the command prompt.



Remarks
• Using the get parameter
	Specify put if transferring file FileTwo on the local computer to file FileOne on remote computer. Specify get if transferring file FileTwo on the remote computer to file FileOne on the remote computer.

• This command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol is installed
as a component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections
