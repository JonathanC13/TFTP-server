## TFTP-server - January 2016 â€“ April 2016
https://github.com/JonathanC13/TFTP-server

Winter 2016 server side of a TFTP group project. Client and error simulator components are in friend repos that are unavailable.

Based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1350 protocol standards to create the server, like packet format and error handling.

## Description

-	Designed and developed the Server side of a Trivial File Transfer System based on the TFTP specifications found online and implemented design decisions made by the team. An example of a design decision if the server receives a write request to a file with a name that already exists on the server's directory then it replies with an error code 6 ; if the client wants to read and save to a file with a name that already exists in its directory then is will overwrite and continues the transfer until completion.

-	The testing method used was to have an error simulator in-between the client and server to alter packet contents to cause certain errors and/or simulate network errors.

-	Assisted team mates on their responsibilities relating to the client side, error simulator, diagrams, and documentation.

## End Remark

    The team had its ups and downs, but in the end I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish.
